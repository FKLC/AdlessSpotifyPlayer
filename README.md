# Adless Spotify Player
#### Why I Made That?
There is 3 reasons why I made that
  1. Because I'm a high school student and Spotify haven't got any plans for us.
  2. Because my premium subscription has ended and Spotify ads are so annoying.
  3. Because long time ago I reported that Spotify webplayer not playing any ads and they just deleted my report awkwardly and put ads to webplayer.

#### So you saying there is ads even if you use this?
Well yes but actually no, after Spotify put ads into webplayer I decided make an another program (or webpage whatever you call) to block ads. If one of them playing program sets volume to zero to prevent listening these annoying ads.

#### Installation
Simply clone this repo and open `index.html` at your browser.

#### Usage
1. Open `index.html`
2. Navigate [here](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-playback-sdk/quick-start/#authenticating-with-spotify) to get access token from Spotify site
3. Click on `Get Your Web Playback SDK Access Token`
4. Agree app access (since it is official Spotify app I can't access that so feel free to use it)
5. When Spotify redirect you to old page again there is should be access token appeared copy that
6. Paste into page you opened at first (`index.html`) and click `Connect`
7. On one of the your devices click to `Connect to a device` and select `Adless Spotify Player`
8. That's all start listening
